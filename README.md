# cntlm-password

*Changing your password for cntlm can be a little tedious*. This program kills
cntlm, prompts you for your username, edits your cntlm conf file and restarts
cntlm.

  * you are using MacOS
  * cntlm and pkill are installed.
  * your cntlm conf file path is "/usr/local/etc/cntlm.conf"
